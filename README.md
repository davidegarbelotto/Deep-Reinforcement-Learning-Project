# Reinforcement Learning Project
The goal of this project is to practice the basics of the Deep Reinforcement Learning framework and explore some advanced methods. All the tasks are developed using environments of the Gym library by OpenAI.

## Task 1
The first task consists of solving the Cart Pole game, using as observation space the 4-dimensional space returned by the environment.

## Task 2
The second task adds a layer of complexity, because in this case the observation space utilized is made of the pixels of the screen. Here, the hardest part is to extract the information
on the state directly from the image seen while playing the game.

## Task 3
The third task instead, solves another environment, the Mountain Car. Here a different strategy is implemented.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Jupyter Notebook
* Google Colab (it has been used for the GPU computation)
